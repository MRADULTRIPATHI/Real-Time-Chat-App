## üë• Project Overview

This repository contains the complete source code for **Pager_X**, a real-time healthcare messaging platform built as a **team project**.

> **Please Note:**  
> The overall project is a collaborative effort. **My primary responsibility and contribution was the entire frontend development** (UI, UX, React integration, API calls, and responsive design).  
> While the repository also includes backend code for completeness, I was not directly involved in backend implementation‚Äîthough I gained exposure to backend concepts through integration work with the team.
